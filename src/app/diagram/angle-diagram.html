        This interactive diagram visualizes a solar panel system. The sun's path is represented by a curved connector, and users can adjust the panel's tilt angle either by direct rotation or using integrated buttons. The system provides immediate feedback through a dynamic efficiency gauge and performance messages. Users can also select different locations to observe how regional variations impact overall solar efficiency.
