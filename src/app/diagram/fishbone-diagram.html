        This example shows how to interact with the diagram control using shortcut keys. The
        <code>commandManager</code> property can be used to map the commands with key gestures. In this example, along with the built-in commands a
        few custom commands are added and a few built-in commands (nudge) are overridden. That is, when the arrow keys are
        pressed, selection will be navigated instead of moving the selected objects. The different kinds of interactions
        and the corresponding key gestures are listed in the property panel.
