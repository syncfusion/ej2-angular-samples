  <p>The File Manager that gives you complete control over who can access your folders and files. With this essential feature, you can define access permissions and create a secure and organized digital environment.
    This File Manager sample demonstrates that the enabled access permission will permit only read action and will not allow the user to perform any write action on the <code>documents</code>, <code>music</code> folders, and the <code>bird image</code> file inside the <code>pictures/nature</code> folder.</p>
