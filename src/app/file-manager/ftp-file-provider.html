    <p>This sample demonstrates how to utilize the File Transfer Protocol file system provider to manage the files in the File Manager component.
       To run the service, create a FTP connection, and then configure the FTP details such as <i><b>host name</b></i>, <i><b>user name</b></i>, and <i><b>password</b></i> in the <code>SetFTPConnection</code> method to perform the file operations.

    <p>The File Manager component is used to explore a file system through a web application, similar to the windows
      explorer for windows. It supports all the basic file operations such as create, rename, delete and so on.</p>

        <b>Note: </b>File Manager's upload functionality is restricted in online demo.
