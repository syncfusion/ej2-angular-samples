    <p>This sample demonstrates how to utilize the File Transfer Protocol file system provider to manage the files in the File Manager component.
       To run the service, create a FTP connection, and then configure the FTP details such as <i><b>host name</b></i>, <i><b>user name</b></i>, and <i><b>password</b></i> in the <code>SetFTPConnection</code> method to perform the file operations.
