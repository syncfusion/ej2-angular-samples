        <p>This sample demonstrates how to efficiently manage resource overallocation by reallocating available resources to
            tasks. It visually updates the Gantt Chart by changing the color of the taskbars to reflect the reallocated
            tasks, allowing for better tracking and management of resource usage. The process helps ensure that no single
            resource is overburdened, maintaining an optimized workflow.

            The sample reallocates tasks to prevent resource overallocation. The reallocation process involves interacting
            with the <strong>TaskCollection</strong>, <strong>ResourceCollection</strong>, and <strong>AssignmentCollection</strong> to generate a new assignment collection.
            This new collection resolves any overallocated tasks by redistributing them within the same resource, ensuring
            balanced resource utilization. Taskbar colors are updated accordingly to indicate the changes in allocation,
            providing clear visual feedback on the resource adjustments.
