    <p>The pivot table is an easily configurable, presentation-quality business control used for visualizing
        relational data
        sources in cross-tabular format. It is displayed with drill-up and drill-down capabilities and allows users to
        easily
        aggregate data. Sorting, filtering, and grouping data are also supported.
