        Disabled Dates sample demonstrates how to disable specific dates in the DatePicker by using
        <code>renderDayCell</code> event. This event gets triggered on each day cell element creation, that allows you to customize, or disable specific
        dates in the DatePicker. Here the weekend dates are disabled by using renderDayCell.
