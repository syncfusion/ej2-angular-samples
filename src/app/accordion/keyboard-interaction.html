            <div>Microsoft ASP.NET is a set of technologies in the Microsoft .NET Framework for building Web
              applications and XML Web
              services. ASP.NET pages execute on the server and generate markup such as HTML, WML, or XML that is sent
              to a desktop
              or mobile browser. ASP.NET pages use a compiled,event-driven programming model that improves performance
              and enables
              the separation of application logic and user interface.</div>

            <div>The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern separates an application into three main
              components: the model,
              the view, and the controller. The ASP.NET MVC framework provides an alternative to the ASP.NET Web Forms
              pattern for
              creating Web applications. The ASP.NET MVC framework is a lightweight, highly testable presentation
              framework that
              (as with Web Forms-based applications) is integrated with existing ASP.NET features, such as master pages
              and membership-based
              authentication.

            <div>JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted computer programming language.It was originally implemented as part
              of web browsers
              so that client-side scripts could interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously,
              and alter
              the document content that was displayed.More recently, however, it has become common in both game
              development and
              the creation of desktop applications.</div>
