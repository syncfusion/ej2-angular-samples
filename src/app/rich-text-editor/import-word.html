    <p>This sample demonstrates the <code>Import/Export</code> feature of the Rich Text Editor, which allows users to
        import
        the Word document into the editor. The word document can be imported as Rich Text Editor content by clicking the
        import to Word icon, browsing for the document, and uploading it to the server, where it is converted to HTML
        and
        then sent to the Rich Text Editor as its value.</p>

    <p><b>Injecting Module</b></p>
    <p>Rich Text Editor features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. In this demo we have used
        following injectable services
        <code>ToolbarService, LinkService, ImageService, HtmlEditorService, QuickToolbarService, TableService, PasteCleanupService,
        ImportExportService</code> into the <code>&#64;NgModule.providers section</code>.
