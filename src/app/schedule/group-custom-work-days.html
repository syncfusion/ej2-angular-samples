        This demo showcases the different available dates of doctors and their appointments on those days.

<div id="description">
    <p>
        In this demo, different working days are assigned by passing the
        <code>workDays</code> collection for each doctor to show their available dates. On each of their available dates, their daily available
        time range is also depicted by mentioning the
        <code>startHour</code> and
        <code>endHour</code> for each doctor. These values needs to be provided along with the resource
        <code>dataSource</code> by mapping the appropriate fields namely
        <code>workDaysField</code>,
        <code>startHourField</code> and
        <code>endHourField</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, we have customized the background cell color of the available times of each doctor using
        <code>renderCell</code> event to denote that, only those timeslots are available for booking appointments. All other cells are simply read-only
        and no appointments can be booked on it. Also, if the applicable timeslot already contains an appointment, then no
        more appointments can be added to that cell which has been prevented by making use of the
        <code>isSlotAvailable</code> function within the
        <code>actionBegin</code> event checking for
        <code>eventCreate</code> and <code>eventChange</code> request type. The resource header is customized by making use of the
        <code>resourceHeaderTemplate</code> option.
