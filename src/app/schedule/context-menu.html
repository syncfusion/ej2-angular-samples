    <p>
        In this example, we have integrated the ContextMenu control separately from application end and set its target
        to Scheduler control. Also, we have used the public methods <code>openEditor</code> through which the default event editor
        is set to open for saving or updating the appointments, <code>deleteEvent</code> to delete the selected appointment, and
        <code>selectedDate</code> to navigate to today's date. In mobile devices, the context menu will open when you tap hold on
        the cells or events.
