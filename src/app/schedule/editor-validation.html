    <p>This demo shows the way of adding default and custom validation rules to the editor fields of Schedule.

        In this demo, the specific fields of Scheduler editor window such as
        <code>subject</code>,
        <code>location</code>,
        <code>description</code>,
        <code>startTime</code> and
        <code>endTime</code> are made to undergo validation such that if it is left as blank, then the default required validation message will
        be displayed in a separate tooltip, on clicking a save button.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, the regex condition has been added to the
        <code>location</code> field, so that if any special characters are typed into it, then the custom validation message will be displayed.
        The
        <code>description</code> field has been validated to restrict the character count to be typed into it between 5 and 500 and not beyond that.
        This validation can be given by making use of the
        <code>validation</code> API available within each
        <code>fields</code> of
        <code>eventSettings</code> property.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from this validation feature, the built-in validation has been provided to the start and end time fields - so that,
        when the selected end time occurs before the start time, a validation message will be displayed as well as when some
        unwanted characters are typed into the date fields, the invalid date message will be alerted.
    </p>
