        This demo showcases the scheduler that lists out the meeting rooms of an office and its availability. The slots which are
        already booked and the lunch time canâ€™t be allowed for any new bookings. Also, the existing bookings which were made
        on past dates were not allowed to edit as well as the new bookings on those past dates will also be not allowed.
    </p>

        Here, the timeline view is grouped with single level of resources by making use of the
        <code>group</code> property. Also, the lunch time blocking is done by block event. The event editor and popup is 
        prevented to open on those blocked time slots as well as on the past bookings by making use of the
        <code>popupOpen</code> event. The
        <code>eventRendered</code> event is utilized in order to make the bookings done on past dates as read-only. To block more than one bookings
        per slot, the
        <code>isSlotAvailable</code> method is used. Also, the resource header displayed at the left panel is customized to render as columns with the
        help of
        <code>resourceHeaderTemplate</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> The dates which lies beyond the current date set to scheduler through
        <code>selectedDate</code> property is considered as the past dates here in this sample.
