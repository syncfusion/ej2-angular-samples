        In this demo, the additional field is added to the default event editor by making use of the
        <code>popupOpen</code> event which gets triggered before the event editor getting opened on Schedule.
        <code>popupOpen</code> is a client-side event that triggers before any of the popups getting opened on Schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, the additional field (any of the form elements) is needed to be provided with the common class
        <code>e-field</code>, so as to handle and process those additional data into the default event object.
