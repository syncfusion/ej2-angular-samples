    <p>This demo showcases how the flat Scheduler looks like with its default set of minimal configurations. Here, some of the
        documentary shows are displayed as events parallel to its relevant telecast timings. The show names are given as

        The Angular Scheduler, a.k.a. event calendar, facilitates almost all calendar features, thus allowing users
        to manage their time efficiently. It features easy resource scheduling, appointments rescheduling through
        editor pop-ups, drag and drop, and a resizing action. It includes wide variety of view modes with unique
        configuration options for each view. The available view modes are listed below, out of which the <code>Week</code>
        view is set as active.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Day</li>
        <li>Week</li>
        <li>Work Week</li>
        <li>Month</li>
        <li>Agenda</li>
        <li>Month Agenda</li>
        <li>Timeline Day</li>
        <li>Timeline Week</li>
        <li>Timeline Work Week</li>
        <li>Timeline Month</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To navigate between views and dates, the navigation options are available at the Scheduler header bar and the
        active view option is highlighted by default. The date range of the active view will also be displayed in the
        header bar, clicking on which will open a calendar popup for ease of desired date selection.</p>

                    <li>Single tapping on cells, will display a “+” icon on the cell. Again tapping on it will open the
                        new event editor.

                <ol style="padding-left:12px;">
                    <li>Tap holding on events, opens a small popup at the top holding the options to edit or delete and
                        also displays the selected event's subject. As a continuation of this action, if user keeps on
                        single tapping on other events, it will allow the multiple event selection. Also, the previous
                        popup remains in opened state, showing the count of the number of events selected. </li>
                    <li>Tap holding the events will also open the tooltip on Schedule.
                    </li>
                    <li>Tap hold the event and try moving it over the scheduler to enable drag and drop action.</li>

        <strong>Module Injection</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The key Scheduler functionalities are maintained as individual feature-wise modules. Therefore to avail with a
        particular feature, appropriate module needs to be injected using <code>Schedule.Inject()</code> method. For
        example, to work with the day view on Scheduler – it is necessary to inject the Day module like <code>Schedule.Inject(Day)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong> Note:</strong>In case, if the module of active view is not injected from the application end – then
        the Scheduler is configured to display the first available option in the <code>views</code> property.
