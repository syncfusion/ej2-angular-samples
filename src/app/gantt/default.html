        In this example, you can see how to render a Gantt Chart with the provided data source. The default timeline
        view week-day mode is applied to Gantt Chart. The dependency lines are enabled in this example to represent the
        execution order or the hierarchy between the phases.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tooltip is enabled for all the UI in this example. To see the tooltip in action, hover the mouse over or tap
        taskbars, timeline units and dependency lines in touch enabled devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gantt component features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use a selection support we need to inject the
        <code>SelectionService</code> into the <code>&#64;NgModule.providers</code> section.
