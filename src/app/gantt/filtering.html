        The filtering feature enables the user to view reduced amount of records based on filter criteria. The column
        menu filtering can be enabled by setting <code>allowFiltering</code> property as <code>true</code> and toolbar
        search box can be enabled by including the search item in the <code>toolbar</code> property.
        Gantt chart also provides support for a set of filtering modes with <code>hierarchyMode</code> property. The
        below are the type of filter mode available in Gantt chart.
        <li><code>Parent</code> - This is the default filter hierarchy mode in Gantt chart. The filtered records are
        displayed with its parent records, if the filtered records not have any parent record then the filtered record alone will be displayed.</li>
        <li><code>Child</code> - The filtered records are displayed with its child record, if the filtered records do
        not have any child record then only the filtered records are displayed.</li>
        <li><code>Both</code> - The filtered records are displayed with its both parent and child record. If the
        filtered records do not have any parent and child record then only the filtered records are displayed.</li>
        <li><code>None</code> - Only the filtered records are displayed.</li>
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Gantt component features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use filtering feature, we need
        to inject <code>Filter</code> module, and use the toolbar support we need to inject <code>Toolbar</code> module.
