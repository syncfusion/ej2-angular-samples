              <p>Neural networks are an exciting field of software development used to calculate outputs from input data. 
              While the idea seems simple enough, the implications of such networks are staggering—think optical character recognition, 
              speech recognition, and regression analysis. With Neural Networks Using C# Succinctly by James McCaffrey, you’ll learn 
              how to create your own neural network to solve classification problems, or problems where the outcomes can only be one of 
              several values. <br/><br/>Learn about encoding and normalizing data, activation functions and how to choose the right one, and ultimately 
              how to train a neural network to find weights and bias values that provide accurate predictions.
              An artificial neural network (sometimes abbreviated ANN, or shortened to just "neural network" when the context is clear) is 
              a software system that loosely models biological neurons and synapses. Before explaining exactly how neural networks work, it is 
              useful to understand what types of problems they can solve. The image represents a typical problem that might be 
              solved using a neural network. <br/><br/>The goal of the problem is to predict a person's political inclination based on his or her 
              gender, age, home location, and annual income. One hurdle for those new to neural networks is that the vocabulary varies 
              greatly.
