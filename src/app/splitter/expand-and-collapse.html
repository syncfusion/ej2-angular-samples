                            C# Succinctly</a>
                        <p>Neural networks are an exciting field of software development used to calculate outputs from
                            input data.
                            While the idea seems simple enough, the implications of such networks are staggering—think
                            optical character recognition,
                            speech recognition, and regression analysis. With Neural Networks Using C# Succinctly by
                            James McCaffrey, you’ll learn
                            how to create your own neural network to solve classification problems, or problems where
                            the outcomes can only be one of
                            several values. <br /><br />Learn about encoding and normalizing data, activation functions
                            and how to choose the right one, and ultimately
                            how to train a neural network to find weights and bias values that provide accurate
                            predictions.
                            An artificial neural network (sometimes abbreviated ANN, or shortened to just "neural
                            network" when the context is clear) is
                            a software system that loosely models biological neurons and synapses. Before explaining
                            exactly how neural networks work, it is
                            useful to understand what types of problems they can solve. The image represents a typical
                            problem that might be
                            solved using a neural network. <br /><br />The goal of the problem is to predict a person's
                            political inclination based on his or her
                            gender, age, home location, and annual income. One hurdle for those new to neural networks
                            is that the vocabulary varies
                            greatly.

                            <p>Capturing and extracting information is one of the most important tasks a developer can perform, and making this task more
                                engaging without relying entirely on specialized tools is an efficient way to improve productivity.

                                Email has become a pillar of our modern and connected society, and it now serves as a primary means of communication. Because each email 
                                is filled with valuable information, data extraction has emerged as a worthwhile skill set for developers in today’s business world. 
                                If you can parse an email and extract data from it, companies that automate processes, e.g., helpdesk systems.
                                <br/><br/>An email can be divided into several parts: subject, body, attachments, sender and receiver(s). 
                                We should also note that the headers section 
                                reveals important information about the mail servers involved in the process of sending and receiving an email. <br/><br/>Before addressing how we can 
                                extract information from each part of an email, we should understand that a mailbox can be viewed as a semistructured database that does 
                                not use a native querying language (e.g., SQL) to extract information.

                            <p>Mastering big data requires an aptitude at every step of information processing. 
                                Post-processing, one of the most important steps, is where you find Apache Spark frequently employed. 
                                Spark Succinctly, by Marko Svaljek, addresses Spark’s use in the ultimate step in handling big data. This e-book, the 
                                third installment in Svaljek’s IoT series, teaches the basics of using Spark and explores how to work with RDDs, Scala and
                                Python tasks, JSON files, and Cassandra.Many of the leading companies in the world today face the problem of big data. 
                                There are various definitions by various authors on what big data actually is. <br/><br/> If you are a newcomer to the field, perhaps the easiest way to explain 
                                the concept is that it’s the data that can’t be handled with traditional computing technologies, which mostly used single 
                                machines to process data. I won’t go into corner cases like, "what if you had a really powerful computer" and so on. 
                                The easiest way to think about big data is that it’s data that can’t be processed or stored by a single machine.
                                Note that on the figure Spark takes input data and produces output data using the same storage. 
                                In practice this can vary, as data can come in from multiple data sources. Most of the examples provided in this
                                book will be relatively simple when it comes to data output and the number of data.
