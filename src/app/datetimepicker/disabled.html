        Disabled Dates sample demonstrates how to disable specific dates in the DateTimePicker by using <code>renderDayCell</code> event. This event gets triggered on each day cell element creation, that allows you to customize, or disable specific dates
        in the DateTimePicker. Here the weekend dates are disabled by using renderDayCell.
