            This demo highlights the advanced capabilities of the Syncfusion Angular ComboBox, specifically focusing on
            the Semantic Search feature:

        <p>
            <strong>Semantic Search:</strong> Users can search for items based on the meaning and context of their queries,
            rather than relying solely on exact keyword matches. This AI-driven feature enhances search accuracy by
            understanding the intent behind user inputs, delivering more relevant and intuitive results. It is especially
            beneficial in applications where finding the right item quickly is crucial.
        </p>
        <p>
            This feature makes the Syncfusion Angular ComboBox a powerful tool for creating more intelligent and
            responsive search interfaces.

            <strong>Semantic Search:</strong> The Semantic Search feature empowers users to find items by interpreting the
            context and meaning of their search queries. Unlike traditional search methods that depend on exact keyword
            matches, Semantic Search understands the intent behind the query, offering more accurate and relevant results.
            This enhances user experience, particularly in complex or large datasets, by making search interactions more
            intuitive and effective.
