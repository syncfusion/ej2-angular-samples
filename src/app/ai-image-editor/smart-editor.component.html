                seamlessly blending the background for a polished finish. It's ideal for effortlessly refining images by
                erasing distractions.</li>
            <li><strong>Background Changer:</strong> Users can easily replace or modify the background, offering the
                flexibility to customize the scene while keeping the main subject intact. This feature enhances creativity
                in image editing.</li>
            <li><strong>Background Remover:</strong> Provides the ability to remove the background from an image, isolating
