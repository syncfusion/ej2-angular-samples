        This demo showcases how to make specific events on the Schedule to be displayed in a read-only mode. The read-only events
        can be simply viewed and prevented from undergoing any edit actions.

    <p>
        In this demo, the events that has occurred on the past hours from the current time are made as read-only and the CRUD actions
        has been prevented on it. Also, the way to make specific events as read-only regardless of time has been done by
        adding an additional field
        <code>ReadOnly</code> to the event object to hold the value for it either as true or false.
    </p>
    <p>
        By checking these two conditions, the events are marked as read-only in this sample and also, visually differentiated the
        shade of the readonly events by setting CSS style and
        <code>aria-readonly</code> attribute to it within the
        <code>eventRendered</code> event which gets triggered before every event rendering on the Schedule user interface.
    </p>
    <p>
        The event editor is prevented to open on these read-only events by setting
        <code>args.cancel = true</code> within the
        <code>popupOpen</code> event which checks for the condition whether the popup type is
        <code>editor</code> and the event is readonly.
