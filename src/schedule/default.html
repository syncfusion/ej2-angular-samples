        documentary shows are displayed as events parallel to its relevant telecast timings. The show names are given as
        event's subject and simply notified of the start and end of it.</p>

        The Schedule is an event calendar which facilitates user with the common Outlook-calendar features, thus allowing them to
        plan and manage the appointments and its time in an efficient manner. It comes with 6 different view modes as listed
        below, out of which the
        <code>Week</code> view is set as active.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Day</li>
        <li>Week</li>
        <li>Work Week</li>
        <li>Month</li>
        <li>Agenda</li>
        <li>Month Agenda</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To navigate between views and dates, the navigation options are available at the Schedule header bar and the active view
        option is highlighted in it by default. The date range of the active view will also be displayed in the header bar,
        clicking on which will open a calendar popup for ease of required date selection. </p>

        <strong>Module Injection</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The key Schedule functionalities are maintained as individual feature-wise modules. Therefore to avail with a particular
        feature, appropriate module needs to be injected into the
        <code>@NgModule.providers</code> section. For example, to work with the day view on Schedule – it is necessary to inject the Day module like
        <code>providers: [DayService]</code> into the
        <code>@NgModule.providers</code> section.
        <p>
            <strong> Note:</strong> In case, if the module of active view is not injected from the application end – then the Schedule
            is configured to display the first available option in the
            <code>views</code> property.
