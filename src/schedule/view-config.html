        In this demo, the
        <code>views</code> property is defined to accept the array of view options and therefore for each view, it is possible to set different
        configurations. In day view, the
        <code>startHour</code> is set to 7 and
        <code>endHour</code> set to 18 whereas in week view, the same is set as 9 and 19 respectively. Also, the
        <code>showWeekend</code> property is set to false only on week view. The customized template is applied to the events on Agenda view alone.

        <code>views</code> property, when it is defined as an array of object can be referred from
